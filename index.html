  <p>If you are seeing this, that means I finally made some ounce of progress. Thank F*CK. Sorry, but I am brand new to all of this and GitHub has become the bane of my existence!!!
  This is perhaps the 8th or 9th web page I have tried to create now. I have attempted to upload html and css files to other repositories, but I get 404 error codes when launching.
  I had one page successfully launch, but it displayed my README.md instead of the html and css!!! AHHHH!!!! I'M LOSING MY MIND FROM TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT!
  This time, I am attemptoing to write an html document from scratch! I will launch the html document as webpage, then go back into my repository and create a CSS page to compliment this one!
