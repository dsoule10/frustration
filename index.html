  <p>If you are seeing this, that means I finally made some ounce of progress. Thank F*CK. Sorry, but I am brand new to all of this and GitHub has become the bane of my existence!!!
  This is perhaps the 8th or 9th web page I have tried to create now. I have attempted to upload html and css files to other repositories, but I get 404 error codes when launching.
  I had one page successfully launch, but it displayed my README.md instead of the html and css!!! AHHHH!!!! I'M LOSING MY MIND FROM TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT!
  This time, I am attempting to write an html document from scratch! I will launch the html document as a webpage, then go back into my repository and create a CSS page to compliment this one!
  </p>

  <h3>Update:</h3><h1>IT WORKED</h1>
  <p>I finally got a page to launch and display what I had written in the html document! Google Gemini helped me out quite a bit.
  I have also successfully added a CSS file to this project! Don't expect anyting too fancy here. I'm just getting my feet wet!
  Now that I can confidently create a page from scratch on GitHub, I need to learn how to create one using preexisting html and css files so I can showcase my CodeCademy projects!</p>
